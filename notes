environment variables and process
=====================================
In Node.js, environment variables are a mechanism to configure an application externally, allowing it to adapt to different environments without modifying the core code. They are key-value pairs stored outside the application, accessible through the process.env object. This is particularly useful for managing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or environment-specific settings. 

In Node.js, the process object is a global object that provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process. It is an instance of EventEmitter, meaning it can emit and listen for events. 

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
